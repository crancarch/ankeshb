### Fine, I’ll admit it: I’m Ankesh Bharti.

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/shermisaurus "GitHub"), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shermisaurus "Twitter"), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/ankeshb8 "Reddit") and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankesh-bharti-734584162/ "LinkedIn").

I identify myself as one heck of a tech nerd who likes web-technologies, F/OSS among many other things. While not serious, which is like most of the times I can be found somewhere between netflix, reddit, blogging, youtube or if the day is otherwise binge reading on my kindle.I identify myself as one heck of a tech nerd who likes web-technologies, F/OSS, android among many other things. PS : Not a party animal at all tho.

Want to chat? Feel free to [email](mailto:ankeshbharti8@gmail.com "email") me, or if you have a question that other people might be interested in as well, open a GitHub issue on [shermisaurus/ama](https://github.com/shermisaurus/ama "ama") so that others can read it, too.

Thank You for reading!
