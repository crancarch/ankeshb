Long story told short, I was on a hunt for getting a free or cheap domain for a portfolio site that I could display on resume/sites as a part of personal branding that would look professional. Being a student doesn't goes with buying domains from your standard _GoDaddies_ given the renewal prices skyrocket to **$$$**.

I came across the free .tk, .ml domains provided by [freenom organization](https://www.freenom.com/en/index.html?lang=en). They looked good until the pop up demanded renewal prices after first year, also not to forget they have a bad reputation for hosting mostly phishing and spam sites.

Some suggested claiming  a [namecheap's _.me_ domain](https://nc.me/) which is being provided for free to students for a year as  part of [Github student program](https://education.github.com/pack). But it seems that I am rather late exploiting the perk given I'd already registered for it a year ago and it's gonna expire soon.

On more deep scrolling through other developer's sites on Github I came to know of [**js.org** initiative](https://js.org/) who were giving  free web-space as subdomains to JavaScript developer to host their projects . All it required to get the subdomain were four simple steps : adding CNAME data to your repo and making a pull request on the subdomain list on their repo.

Posted a tweet as well thanking work of Stefan Keim who's solely responsible for the  js.org non-profit initiative, Cheers :)

    The portfolio site's deployed on GitHub Pages plainly without any CI/CD and the theme's inspired by Peter Amende's portfolio site @https://peteramende.de/.
