Long story told short, I was on a hunt for getting a free or cheap domain for a portfolio site that I could display on resume/sites as a part of personal branding that would look professional. Being a student doesn't goes with buying domains from your standard GoDaddies given the renewal prices skyrocket to $$$.

I came across the free .tk, .ml domains provided by freenom organization. They looked good until the pop up demanded renewal prices after first year, also not to forget they have a bad reputation for hosting mostly phishing and spam sites.

Some suggested getting me a namecheap's _.me_ domain which is being provided for free to students for a year as a part of github student program. But it sees I am rather late exploiting the perk given I already registered for it a year ago and it's gnna expire soon.

On more deep search I came to know of [**js.org** intitative](https://js.org/) who were giving  free webspace as subdomains to JavaScript developer to host their projects . All it required to get the subdomain were four simple steps : adding CNAME data to your repo and making a pull request on the subdomain list on their repo.

Posted a tweet thanking work of Stefan Keim solely for responsible for js.org non-profit intiative, Cheers :)

    The portfolio site's deployed on GitHub Pages plainly without any CI/CD and the theme's inspired by Peter Amende's portfolio site @https://peteramende.de/.
