## The Reason

The reason can be laid simply as I wanted to become developer the day I saw wizards building cool things on web, it gave me a sense of empowerment and all this stuff are the coolest one thing one can get their hands, and for specially the orgasmic feeling coding gives wile tinkering with it.

Last year 2018, I started my noob journey with not much computers or any background whatsoever so by taking the leap of faith to install a Linux distribution on my new laptop. It was Ubuntu Budgie as far as I remember, and I got hold of the ecosystem for the few initial months and not shortly I was distro hopping. I came along almost all major Linux distributions and am now pretty much settled with the Arch based Manjaro distribution and am using KDE as a WM, more on this part in a future blog post. I was for the most year confused whether from where and how to get started with things and the worse part I had not figured out what I had to learn until November I realized it was Web Technologies and Web Development. Coding algorithms, complex logic, the competitive coding sport arena did not appealed me much. Apart from a one semester course of basics of C programming, SQL, HTML and python that had been taught in college I have not done much till the end of year. I figured out rather late that cp was not cup of my tea and I should rather focus on development.

For all the November I researched heavily for the best resources to learn JS and other web technologies and got started learning. The THINKFUL 2 week free course gave me a real good head start with sematic HTML, CSS, jQuery and AJAX that I was able to build a small GitHub based web app just on time before the new year eve.

Erik Trautman explained on [this post](https://www.thinkful.com/blog/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard/) the multiple phases and difficulties of learning how to code. I realized that I am done with the Hand Holding Honeymoon part and pretty much into cliff of confusion. The next coming phase - desert of despair daunts me as much as it's name. Currently I am happy with the slow but steady progress done on learning Introductory JavaScript which I am learning basically from a book named Eloquent JS authored by Marjin Haverbeke. The book gets complex and concise in it's later part where I refer [https://javascript.info](https://javascript.info "https://javascript.info")[ ](https://javascript.info)and Mozilla's MDN for learning the concepts.

I have sorted out some plans for the journey well ahead of Phase 3 part to get an edge on learning.

I'll like to quote 3 points from Carlo Teran's dev.to post

1. **Have a goal**. I realized that I was trying to learn too many things at once. I needed to write down my goal and learn to say 'no' to those interesting things that can be unproductive and distracting.
2. **Find a path (write a plan)**. I needed to write a plan that will lead me to achieve my goal. This way I can decide which curriculum to follow and stick to it.
3. **Focus**. I believe that this post will help me to keep my sanity and stick to this plan even when it gets difficult. I need to constantly trust my judgment and remember why I am writing this today. By sharing this to you I am publicly committing to follow this plan and write the results of it at the end of the year.

I pretty much abide by his thinking. I would like to format the post here in the way he did. Given I am not much experienced yet the content would be rather brief.

## The Goal

Copying the same paragraph from his post (and I assume this ain't called plagiarism, hah ;) )

> Going back to the T-Shaped type of programmer. I would like to have a good understanding on general Web Development concepts and technologies, but I would like to have a deeper knowledge on **Javascript.**

TIll the end of this year I want to be comfortable with working and writing code in Javascript and knowledge of few frameworks for building real stuff with. I would also like to make open source contributions specially those who participate in the yearly Google Summer Of Code Program and get selected in one of them to get the opportunity of working on industrial level projects, well that's a lot to say but what harm is to try.

## The Plan

I would like to learn the very first 1) Javascript language itself till intermediate stage or until my thirst is quenched, next 2) I would like to make a portfolio website attached to a blog and automatic newsletter system. I'm willing to use Gatsby and Netlify to build the static portfolio site with CSS Sematic UI framework / or maybe a complete framework (acc to need which is yet to be figured out) and would work around to get a working blog started using Ghost and I've SendGrid's Student Plan perks to use it for automated blog posts newsletters.

I won't stick to humble points and terms but I've got some road-maps which I would love to follow this year to my heart's content for building projects with the best practices after I've learned enough of JS to get started with them. I like doing things methodologically and professionally or you call as it's being done in software production.

For my share of quarterly plans, I am rather hesitant to list them but I'll go along, it's just the lack of confidence that desert of despair initial phase kicks in you.

I'll just take track of one thing that at a time I'll only learn or only build, not simultaneously.

### Q1 - Learning Language and some DevOps for fun

* Finish Eloquent Javascript with proper understanding of text material and exercises with the concepts being taught.
* Learning some bash CLI Scripting
* Maybe get started with Codewars for code practice? And yes YDKSJ book if I get the time and hold of it.
* DOM Enlightenment
* CSS and JS workings
* Learn advanced Git practises
* If time allows, server sided scripting and maybe start off with Node.js

#### Weekly Commitments

* Giving 15-20 hours weekly on working days and on holidays - FULL SURGE!
* Taking time apart for learning DevOps and keep on with other near stuff (server architecture, Linux and sys-admin stuff, the non coding part basically).

### Q2 - Building Things

* Making a personal portfolio website with a blog and newsletter system.
* For the portfolio site, learning a front end frameworks (to be cherry picked at that time after research and requirements).
* Learning Node.js for backend.
* Doing 30 days vanilla JS by Wes Bos.
* Understanding colors, design schemes and in depth CSS to get things baked out hot.

### Q3 - Back-End part and Gearing up for Open Source contributions.

* Learn about Testing, Test Coverage and a special corner for [http://coverage.nodejs.org/](http://coverage.nodejs.org/ "http://coverage.nodejs.org/")
* Learn a query language, preferably GraphQL.
* Learn a DBMS preferably, a noSQL based one.
* Learn about APIs.
* Learn some common software design patterns and Style Guides.
* Make PWAs using Ionic framework and get hands dirty with Firebase for live analytics.
* Polish off the portfolio website to push it to a MVP.
* Finding an opensource organisation making making connections with the community and starting off with contributions.

## Q4 - Wrapping up and Cloud

* Deployment with Heroku.
* Learning CI/CD techniques and using GitLab
* Webpack fundamentals.
* Build features like: Uploads to S3, Auth0, email transactions and deploy a personal hobby side project.
* Make significant contributions to the chosen organisation and gearing up for GSOC proposal.
* Getting familiar with Cloud containers.
* Wrapping up the portfolio website with it's full functionality and applying all that have been learnt this year and carrying it on to the next year.
* Not but the least review and improve JavaScript skills.

## Conclusion

I don't know how much of this definitive yet sky rocketing for a noob lists can get finished off but I loved writing it a hell lot and I hope learning them be even more orgasmic than pain. **I have not got a pair programmer to code with yet and if you reading this feel like you can relate to my noobish levels I am more than glad to work out the path with you, the path will be much more exciting to get along with you. Hit me up at the mail or the social links on footer! The twitter handle is @ankeshb8.**

Also by sharing this with you it lets me feel responsible to sticking to said things and I hope coming out of desert of despair by the end of this year where the next year I can comfortably attend conferences and meetups and learn from other developers from community and take part in hackathons.

Thank you and wish me luck!
